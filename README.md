# Arlaide Databases Workshop

This workshop is aimed for students of EPITA SIGL 2021.

In this workshop, you will learn:
- how to create a database
- how to manage it
- how to query your data from your web api

Since there is several different types of databases, we've prepared different examples with different databases:
- [A relational database using PostgreSQL](postgresql/)
- [A NoSQL document oriented database using MongoDB](mongodb/)
